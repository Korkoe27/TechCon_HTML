## Topics Covered This Week

This week's tasks focus on foundational web development using **HTML** to create a multi-page conference website. The key topics include:

- **Semantic HTML**: Utilizing semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) to structure content clearly and enhance accessibility.
- **Accessibility Standards**: Implementing accessible features such as `alt` attributes for images, `label` tags for form inputs, and subtitles or descriptions for embedded media like videos.
- **Navigation Consistency**: Creating a uniform navigation menu across all pages with proper links to other HTML files (`index.html`, `about.html`, `schedule.html`, `register.html`, `contact.html`).
- **Forms and User Input**: Designing user-friendly forms for registration and contact purposes, incorporating input types (`text`, `email`, `password`, `checkbox`, `textarea`) and submit buttons.
- **Embedded Media**: Integrating multimedia elements like promotional videos (`<video>`), images (`<img>`), and Google Maps iframes (`<iframe>`) with attention to responsiveness and accessibility.
- **Table Structure**: Building an accessible table for the schedule page using `<table>`, `<th>`, `<td>`, and `<caption>` tags with appropriate scope attributes.
- **Basic Website Structure**: Organizing a multi-page website within a single directory (`techcon_website`) in a GitHub repository (`TechCon_HTML`), focusing on HTML without CSS or JavaScript.

These topics emphasize creating a functional, accessible, and well-structured static website, aligning with the ALX Software Engineering Program's focus on HTML fundamentals.
